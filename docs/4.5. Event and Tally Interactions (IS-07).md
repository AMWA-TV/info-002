IS-10 adds security to the traditional Event and Tally HTTP requests.

## IS-07 Events API

The `Events API` exposed by an IS-07 NMOS Device in the controls array under `urn:x-nmos:control:events/v1.0` can be accessed in an authorized way by including the Access Token (`Authorization: Bearer`) in the HTTP header.

```http
GET /x-nmos/events/v1.0/sources/{sourceId} HTTP/1.1
Host: node.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...
```

The Access Token must contain the read claim matching the Source path which is to be returned in the response.

For example, access to the IS-07 Source ID '9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b' would require token claims as follows.

```json
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b"]
}
```

Access to all IS-07 Source IDs can be requested with a token claim as follows.

```json
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/*"]
}
```

## IS-07 WebSocket Events

The WebSocket Uri for an IS-07 NMOS Device exposed in the `connection_uri` parameter can be accessed in an authorized way by:

* including the Access Token (`Authorization: Bearer`) in the HTTP header of the request that initiates the WebSocket handshake
* passing the Access Token as a query parameter (`ws://hostname/x-nmos/events/v1.0/devices/58f6b536-ca4c-43fd-880a-9df2501fc125?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...`) - only for situations in which it is not feasible to pass the token in the HTTP Authorization Header.

The IS-07 NMOS Node/Device hosting the WebSocket server shall support Authorization using either of the above mechanisms.

The Access Token must contain the read claim matching all Source paths which are to be returned by the WebSocket.

For example, access to the IS-07 Source IDs '9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b' and '7f87027c-ebb4-4640-b878-14952915249a' would require token claims as follows.

```json
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/9f463872-9621-4939-aa3a-dc3c82d8578b",
           "sources/7f87027c-ebb4-4640-b878-14952915249a"]
}
```

Access to all IS-07 Source IDs can be requested with a token claim as follows.

```json
"x-nmos-events": {
  "read": ["sources/*"]
}
```

## IS-07 MQTT Events

Within the current specification only the WebSocket workflow is secured, while the MQTT workflow is not yet secured.
