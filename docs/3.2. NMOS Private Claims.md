# Private Claims
_(c) AMWA 2021, CC Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)_

IS-10 has introduced some NMOS related private claims, which are related to the NMOS scopes. These claim names begin `x-nmos-` followed by the namespace identifier found in the URL for that given API (e.g. “registration”, “query”,  "connection", etc.). Each NMOS private claim specifies the read and write permission.  Wildcards ('*') can be used to fine tune the level of access. In the following example, the token has been given full read and write permission for accessing the`registry.example.com` IS-04 `Registration API`.
