## Overview
This section details the interactions between an NMOS Controller and the Authorization Server. These include:

- **Discovery of the Authorization Server**
- **Client Registration**: Registration of the NMOS Controller with the Authorization Server.
- **Authentication Code Flow**: Request of an Access Token from the Authorization Server.
- **Refreshing the Bearer Token**: Ensuring the token is always valid

The sequence diagram above gives an overview of these interaction which are described in more detail below.
## Discovery of the Authorization Server
In order to interact with the Authorization Server, you need to know where it is.  IS-10 specifies that the [Authorization Server should use unicast DNS-SD](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/3.0._Discovery.html#dns-sd-advertisemen) to advertise itself to the  Controller.

Once the Controller knows the whereabouts of the Authorization Server it can then fetch the [Authorization Server Metadata](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/3.0._Discovery.html#authorization-server-metadata-endpoint) to obtain supported features and endpoints.

Example request to get server metadata:

```http
GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.example.com
```
Example server metadata HTTP response:
```http

  ]
}
```
## Client Registration 
The NMOS Controller first needs to register with the Authorization Server. This is usually a one time operation that a Controller would typically perform when first activated on the network.

The registration is done via a [dynamic client registration](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.2._Behaviour_-_Clients.html#client-registration) with the Authorization Server. The registration includes the expected grant type, which should be set to  [authorization code grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)

Depending on how the Authorization Server has been configured, it is likely that the Client Registration will need to be authenticated using an Initial Access Token.  This token will be generated by the Authentication Server, and provided to the NMOS Controller by some proprietary method. 

Example public client registration request including an Initial Access Token (This is the `Authorization: Bearer` in the HTTP header):

_NOTE: The parameters passed as part of the dynamic client registration of NMOS Controllers is different to those passed when registering an NMOS Nodes._
```http
POST /register HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIg...
```
```json
{
  "client_name": "My Example Controller",
  "grant_types": [
    "authorization_code",
    "refresh_token"
  ],
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://controller.example.com/auth/callback"
  ],  
  "response_types": [
    "code"    
  ],
  "scope": "channelmapping connection events node query",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```
Example response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json    	
{
  "client_id": "40baf617-1744-4c24-9baf-22351bec1a73",

    "refresh_token"
  ],
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://controller.example.com/auth/callback"
  ],
  "response_types": [
    "code"
  ],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

## Authentication Code Flow
NMOS Controllers are OAuth 2.0 [public clients](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.2._Behaviour_-_Clients.html#user-agent-based--browser-applications) which means they cannot securely store the Client Secret.

To accommodate these public clients, OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization Code Flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) (defined in [OAuth 2.0 RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)). 

- To start the Authentication Code Flow, in place of a Client Secret,
   the Controller generates a cryptographically-random
   [`code_verifier`](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.3._Behaviour_-_Token_Requests.html#authorization-request-and-response) which is used to generate a  [`code_challenge`](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.3._Behaviour_-_Token_Requests.html#authorization-request-and-response)
   value. 
- The client redirects the Controller to the Authorization Server
   [`/authorize`](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/2.0._APIs.html#authorization-endpoints) passing the `code_challenge` as a parameter.

Example request to start authorization code flow:
```http
GET /authorize
?client_id=30baf617-1744-4c24-9baf-22351bec1a73
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2controller.example.com/auth/callback
&response_type=code
&code_challenge=HbYjeCHvDfKpyYacEHKLdffF0geuyu3A-b4ir7ZG8-E
&code_challenge_method=S256
&state=ricgtUUXODcOzifiJDnOw25rZ8wTZCxU
&scope=channelmapping%20connection%20events%20node%20query
HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.example.com
```

- The Authorization Server will redirects the client to the login and
   authorization prompt.
- The Controller operator can then login and give consent on the
   Authorization Server for the Controller.
- The Authorization Server then redirects back to the
   Controller via the registered redirect URI, passing the authorization code as a parameter.

Example of authorization code returned via the redirect URI (In this example the authorization code is passed in the `code` parameter):
```http
GET /auth/callback
?state=ricgtUUXODcOzifiJDnOw25rZ8wTZCxU
&code=2b7488e0-0682-42bb-893c-9d09e60bf8...
```

-  The Controller can now exchange the authorization code for the bearer
   token, by sending the authorization code and the `code_verifier` to
   the Authorization Server.

Example request to exchange authorization code for bearer token. (In this request the `code` is the authorization code):
```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```
```
client_id=30baf617-1744-4c24-9baf-22351bec1a73
&redirect_uri=https://controller.example.com/auth/callback
&code=2b7488e0-0682-42bb-893c-9d09e60bf8...
&grant_type=authorization_code
&code_verifier=ricgtUUXODcOzifiJDnOw25rZ8wTZCxUxf...
&scope=channelmapping connection events node query
```


Example token response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...",
  "expires_in": 180,
  "refresh_expires_in": 1800,
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia...",
  "scope": "channelmapping connection events node query",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

## Refreshing the Bearer Token
The Bearer Token has a limited life specified by the value of the `expires_in` parameter in seconds.  The Node should refresh the token before [it exceeds its half life](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.4._Behaviour_-_Access_Tokens.html#access-token-lifetime) (for example if the token lifetime is 30 seconds, then it should be refreshed at least 15 seconds before token expiry). 

Because refresh tokens have the potential for a long lifetime, developers should ensure that strict storage requirements are in place to keep them from being leaked.

Example request to refresh bearer token:
```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```
```
client_id=30baf617-1744-4c24-9baf-22351bec1a73
&grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia...
```

In this request the `refresh_token` was previously got from the bearer token.

Example token response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSl...",
  "expires_in": 180,
  "refresh_expires_in": 1800,
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia...",
  "scope": "channelmapping connection events node query",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

Note that if a Node is unable to contact an Authorization Server, it should attempt to contact another Authorization Server from the discovered list until this [either succeeds or the list is exhausted](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-10/branches/v1.0-dev/docs/4.5._Behaviour_-_Resource_Servers.html#public-keys).
