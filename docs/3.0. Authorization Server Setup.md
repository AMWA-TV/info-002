IS-10 is all about authorization, so you will need an Authorization Server from which you request  Access Tokens.  Here you will find some detail on setting up an Authorization Server to provide the correct 'flavor' of Access Tokens to your NMOS Nodes.

## [Keycloak Setup](3.1.%20Keycloak%20Setup.md)
IS-10 will work with any OAuth 2.0 and OpenID compliant Authorization Server. However, for the purposes of this guide we have used Keycloak which is an open source Identity and Access Management solution.

## [Private Claims](3.2.%20NMOS%20Private%20Claims.md)
This section describes how IS-10 makes use of Private Claims to control access to NMOS APIs.
